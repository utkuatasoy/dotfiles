# Skill: Conventional Commits

Git commit conventions for this user. Follow these rules when creating commits.

---

## Commit Message Format

Single-line only, no body:

```
<type>(optional-scope): <imperative subject>
```

## Rules

- No emoji
- No multiline body or description
- No `Co-Authored-By` or any co-author attribution
- Keep under ~72 characters
- Imperative mood (add, fix, remove, refactor)
- No "generated by..." text

## Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Formatting only (no logic) |
| `refactor` | Code change without feat/fix |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Tests only |
| `chore` | Tooling/config/housekeeping |
| `ci` | CI/CD related |

## Examples

- `feat: add user session timeout handling`
- `fix: prevent null pointer in payment validation`
- `refactor: simplify request parsing logic`
- `chore: update eslint configuration`
- `docs: update API endpoint documentation`

## Splitting Commits

Split when:
- Different concerns (UI + backend + infra)
- Mixed types (feat + refactor + fix)
- Large change set (>25 files or >800 lines)

Order: chore/ci → refactor → feat → fix → docs/test

## Important

- Never use `git add .` for large changesets
- Stage by path or hunk for controlled commits
- Review with `git diff --staged` before committing
